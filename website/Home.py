st.markdown("FraudCatch `alpha` is a fraud detection project that uses real-time cloud tech to deliver near instant inferences. \
          The project uses a Kafka producer to send data to a Kafka topic, which is then consumed by a Kafka consumer. \
          We have used distributed processing using Apache Spark to process the data and make predictions using a trained model. \
          To see this project in action, please navigate to the 'Connect' page.\nThanks! ðŸ˜Š")
